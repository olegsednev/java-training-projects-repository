Here i'll publish java core practice and neccessary tools (log4j2, jUnit, hibernate and so on)

1. BladeBalancer:
Disctiption: This is my first commer—Åial programm. It have given an opportunity to my organisation to prepare for some tests. This programm gives an ability to arrange blades on disk besides some of blades have fixed positions. Fixing their possitions before arranging is neccessary to meet test's demands.
Before this programm we have an ability to arrange all of them without fixing even 1 blade. But to meet test demands we used to arrange them with no computer, just with a paper and a pencil. It was complicated and it's occurance was not very good.
